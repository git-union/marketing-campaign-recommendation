          "text":"I just found out that the town of Evanston allows store owners to discriminate.  According to the town there is no equal access under disability law.  So it looks like the store D&D Finer foods can limit access to wheelchair bound people like me.  The ADA\u2019s manager for the town of Evanston and her supervisor have\nnow informed me there is no such thing as equal access under the law.  The supervisor was\nrude and talked more than she listened.  So I will just have to live with the store treating me differently than able bodied people.  D&D Finer Foods is way overpriced and the only reason I go there is because it\u2019s the only convenience store in my area that\u2019s close to me.   Normally I order from Walmart and get my items delivered because it is so much cheaper than this place.  I use an electric wheelchair and am disabled.  This store discriminates against people with disabilities.  Do not come here if you are handicapped and or disabled.  The store owner\/manager Kosta Douvikas masterfully gets around the law to be able to discriminate against the disabled.  I even made a complaint with the ADA manager for the town of Evanston.   The ADA manager is allowing the store owner to discriminate against the disabled by suggesting options that reinforce the discrimination.   The store owner\/manager told me to not shop on Thursdays because that is his stocking day.  When I questioned him about not allowing me to shop on Thursdays he told me to come later in the day.  So now he wants to dictate what day and time people with disabilities can shop.  He then offers to shop for me instead of allowing me to do my own shopping.  Under the law people with disabilities are allowed equal access but trying to enforce that is the problem.  And especially when the towns ADA manager backs the owner up.  My whole problem is people in wheelchairs are suppose to have the same access as able bodied people.  It's extremely stressful trying to maneuver around boxes in the aisles with my electric wheelchair.  The owner alleges I went down aisles that I didn't buy anything.  So now I'm not allowed to look around like able bodied shoppers.   But again who do you turn to when the town you live in not willing to enforce the law.  And finding a civil rights attorney when you are low income is next to impossible.  I am finding that Evanston is not a town that lives up to their claim of inclusion.  Another excuse the owner claims is he is a small store and doesn't have the room to put the boxes.  I don't think he realizes that even small stores have to allow equal access under the law.  The police suggested I call them if when I go there things are blocking access for my wheelchair so they can see first hand what is taking place.  And the same owner is claiming he has had several complaints about my attire.  When I go their I am fully covered.  But he decided to point out my attire by attacking my appearance.   He never mentioned it until I gave him a negative review.   So I guess in the end he is allowed to discriminate against the disabled because we are an easy vulnerable target that doesn't have the resources to enforce the laws against discrimination.",

          "text":"I hate leaving negative feedback especially because I'm a longterm customer of World Market dating all the way back to when there was a World \ud83c\udf0e Market location in Lakeview.\n\nYesterday evening after leaving the movie theater I decided to do some browsing here just to check in on fun products and goodies and snacks since it was New Year's Eve.  I came here completely alone --didn't have my pyrenees with me because I left AMC theater \ud83c\udfa5 and some people from the audience might be allergic to dogs.\n\nI'm wandering around and was surprised to see only two employees in the entire store and shelves barren and empty.  There was a feeling of gloom like this store might be about to close down.  Still I searched for snacks got a tiny candle and a big bag of spicy crackers \ud83c\udf8a mix and a cake that was labeled at 50% off.\n\nI couldn't find anyone at the register then got the attention of a woman who was organizing merchandise near the front.  The store looked barren and the two employees here seemed glum.\n\nWhen I returned to my space I opened up the big bag of snacks and was extremely disappointed to find there were barely any Japanese rice crackers but a ton of spicy \ud83e\udd5c \ud83e\udd5c peanuts and other snacks that set my mouth on fire.  I love spicy things but mouth was stinging.  My dog needed a walk and I thought nothing about asking for a quick return or exchange since I only had a tablespoon full of the opened product .\n\nAs I entered i asked the clerk what their return or exchange policy was and she genuinely felt bad for me but was extremely disturbed that I had my dog with me.  She seemed like she had a deep seated fear of dogs and demanded i take my dog outside because there's food products in their store.  I tied my dog up outside on a bike rack and politely inquired about an exchange for the traditional Japanese rice crackers I had overlooked earlier.  The store is so disorganized and half empty it made it super hard for me to find what I actually needed.  The other employee said I wasn't allowed to exchange my snack for another and I was dismissed and left with my dog.

          "text":"I hate leaving negative feedback especially because I'm a longterm customer of World Market dating all the way back to when there was a World \ud83c\udf0e Market location in Lakeview.\n\nYesterday evening after leaving the movie theater I decided to do some browsing here just to check in on fun products and goodies and snacks since it was New Year's Eve.  I came here completely alone --didn't have my pyrenees with me because I left AMC theater \ud83c\udfa5 and some people from the audience might be allergic to dogs.\n\nI'm wandering around and was surprised to see only two employees in the entire store and shelves barren and empty.  There was a feeling of gloom like this store might be about to close down.  Still I searched for snacks got a tiny candle and a big bag of spicy crackers \ud83c\udf8a mix and a cake that was labeled at 50% off.\n\nI couldn't find anyone at the register then got the attention of a woman who was organizing merchandise near the front.  The store looked barren and the two employees here seemed glum.\n\nWhen I returned to my space I opened up the big bag of snacks and was extremely disappointed to find there were barely any Japanese rice crackers but a ton of spicy \ud83e\udd5c \ud83e\udd5c peanuts and other snacks that set my mouth on fire.  I love spicy things but mouth was stinging.  My dog needed a walk and I thought nothing about asking for a quick return or exchange since I only had a tablespoon full of the opened product .\n\nAs I entered i asked the clerk what their return or exchange policy was and she genuinely felt bad for me but was extremely disturbed that I had my dog with me.  She seemed like she had a deep seated fear of dogs and demanded i take my dog outside because there's food products in their store.  I tied my dog up outside on a bike rack and politely inquired about an exchange for the traditional Japanese rice crackers I had overlooked earlier.  The store is so disorganized and half empty it made it super hard for me to find what I actually needed.  The other employee said I wasn't allowed to exchange my snack for another and I was dismissed and left with my dog. Super cold and off putting vibes from both of these women and I just got off the phone with the other location just now in Lincoln Park and they said they welcome service dogs and they are dog friendly and because all their food products are clearly sealed they have no issues with a service animal or any well mannered, leashed dog entering their store.\n\nI'm so disappointed with the treatment I received here i had to write this review.

          "text":"I used to frequent this little convenience store, but that all changed one day when the guy who works there tried to rip me off (and I think he owns the shop, too...he's the only person I've ever seen working in the place).\n\nThis is what happened: I was buying a drink marked for 99 cents + tax (actually, those 99 cent drinks were the only reason I went there, as I couldn't find them anywhere else in town back then). So I went and took my drink up to the counter to pay for it (remember, it was marked for 99 cents + tax, which came to a total at the time of $1.08). I took a dollar bill out of my wallet, handed the guy who works there the bill, and reached into my pocket for the other 8 cents I owed to cover tax. I looked down at the change to count out the 8 cents, which took all of about 3 seconds, then I handed the guy the 8 cents, grabbed my drink and turned to leave.\n\nAt this point, the guy behind the counter said \"Hey - you still owe me a dollar. give me a dollar.\" Thinking that the guy had somehow forgotten that I had already handed him the dollar bill, I said to him, \"I did give you a dollar. I handed you a dollar bill before I got out the change I needed to finish paying you, remember?\" He started to sound a bit frustrated at this point, saying \"No you didn't! Give me a dollar now, or you can't leave with that drink!\" This set off a \"red flag\" to me, as I knew that I had handed him my only dollar bill...indeed, it was the only paper money I had had on me at the time, so I responded \"I know I gave you that dollar bill. I don't owe you anything else right now.\" Now he was getting pretty upset, and he angrily demanded that I owed him a dollar still. It was at this point in the argument that I said to him in an angry, but normal-volume voice \"Look, I know I gave you a dollar, and then I gave you the eight cents to cover tax too. If you don't believe me, then go ahead and check the security camera footage!\" This made him go quiet for a moment, after which he waved his hand dismissively and said \"Get out of here!\"\n\nI then left with my legally purchased drink in hand, calling over my shoulder \"You tried to cheat me, so you just lost a customer for life! I hope you're happy with that!\" Needless to say, I've never gone back into that store since then.\n\nA lot of other people I know still shop there without any issues, but I'm in no rush to trust the guy who works there again. Let this be a cautionary message to anyone who might think to shop there: chances are that you will be able to buy stuff there without any problems, but there is still a chance that the guy might try to pull the same kind of stunt on you that he tried on me. My advice? Hold onto your cash until you have gotten out enough to pay for your stuff, and then give it all to the guy at once. Keep an eye on whether or not he gives correct change, and make sure that you don't end up getting played for the fool by this guy. Or you could just walk the one block east (toward and then past the train tracks) to 7-11, and shop there instead.\n\nIt's your money, and your choice.",

Although sometimes when things are not in season it can be high.\nThe deli is also good. Chicken is good there too, I don't really recommend the beef as much in the butcher shop. The pork there is usually excellent.\nThe fun thing about the place is that they also have a lot of things that you won't find anywhere else, especially with ethnic foods. It can be quite busy there as it is quite popular.",
