Today while I was at the self checkout at Star Market, 1065 Commonwealth Ave (Store #3588), I overheard a troubling loud situation at the service desk and decided Id stick around a bit to see how it would be handled. A customer was aggressively yelling at a worker\u2014completely inappropriate behavior. The employee Dayana remained calm, professional, and tried her best to help despite being treated with hostility and disrespect.\n\nShe eventually called for help, which was absolutely the right thing to do. But instead of supporting her, Ludgero, who Ive just found out is STORE DIRECTOR ( according to store receipts!) showed up and made the situation worse. I clearly heard him say to her \u201cNext time I will fire you for that.\u201d as I was walking by ready to head out.\n\nNot a word to the angry customer. No support for his staff. Just a cold threat to an employee who was visibly shaken up and still trying to do her job.\n\nThat is unacceptable. This employee handled herself with composure under pressure, and she deserved to be backed up not intimidated by her own manager. If this is how Star Market management treats their staff in front of customers, it reflects a toxic and broken leadership culture.\n\nI sincerely hope corporate sees this because that manager owes her an apology, and Star Market owes her better.\n\nIf you shop here and care about how employees are treated, speak up. No one should fear losing their job for handling an abusive customer the right way!!",

I would rather shop in person, but $60 for this cart is very unreasonable, especially considering there are many Indian students living nearby with few other options.\n\nI understand the high prices may not be the fault of this store, but the prices have gotten out of hand.\n\nStill, I love this store.",

Ive visited probably a dozen times at this point, and every time I've hoped for improvement but it's just not happening so here goes.\n\nThe good: fresh ingredients and bread and relatively quick service, All things considered.\n\nThe bad: The menu is a disaster. They have paper menus which include in the ballpark of 30 different sandwiches and paninis. They also have little placards floating around with additional handwritten options, as well as a specials board that adds even more different items everyday. In total, I'd wager that they offer around 40 different sandwich options. One would think that means that there's something for everyone, unfortunately that's not the case though. They don't have any of the traditional staples-- no Italian, no chicken pesto, no chicken Cesar or turkey and Swiss. They do have menu items that start with these sandwiches, but then they add on all sorts of other seemingly random ingredients to create a new sandwich that looks nothing like the original. This wouldn't be a huge problem if it was easy to customize an existing menu item. I've tried doing that again and again though, and literally half the time it's incorrect.\n\nI hope they're able to turn things around. The staff has always been friendly and helpful and I'm certainly rooting for them. I probably won't be back for a while though",

Price is on the \"okay\" side (not cheap). But there are some good weekly deals one may take advantage of. Most disappointed though, that the online sign up does not work. The verification email does not get sent. Tried multiple times with multiple emails and asked other people to try making an account, no one was able to get the verification email to work. Customer service desk manually put in the details (which I later hated because they got extra information out of me with my Driver's License that was not required to create Account online). But you still have to LINK your card to the online account I cannot create. Got no apologies for this inconvenience and wasting an hour of my time. Customer service (on the phone) was closed for the weekend. The service desk in the Shop told me to call tomorrow as they can't fix the issue, but I don't want to waste more of my own time to fix a company's problem. Found it very frustrating how no-one took ownership and kept saying it must be my email\/phone\/network that is the issue. And yes, I checked the Spam folder multiple times. Will probably not Shop here unless I super-urgently need something because of the location. Not cheap, bad customer service, even basic online function does not work. Quality of produce and products were okay, cleanliness great, felt safe inside and around the store. Uploading some updated photos as the ones I checked before coming into the store were from 7 years ago. Cheers.",

          "text":"I have fond memories of this place from when I was a child. I like the store and the chain of Trader Joes and this place really sticks out to me. In other stores I usually have a hard time navigating through the people of color, especially the darker ones. I think this store is kept nice and clean, the hispanic workers with curly hair do the job well.  My last trip I spoke to yojana (the kindest girl ever) about the organic prpduce and she was super helpful, then also this other worker andy. These are examples of workers we need now and I believe both of them might be together so he kind of gave me a bit of unwanted attitude. It should be brought up to the super's attention that somehting fishy may be brewing. I urge the managers to take action because he sure is cruisin for a bruisin.\n\nGreat store for the organice product, and good prices too!! ",

And- so many other things you may not imagine like standard grocery items like nutella, crackers, chips, milk, eggs, spices (eg basil, dill, onion powder), personal hygiene products, pans, utensils, various kitchen gadgets. This is a great sized grocery store ( smaller than regular). Easy to navigate, well laid out, well lit. You can truly do a full grocery shopping here, not just for specialty items.\n\nCustomer service was a bit nonexistent. Not unpleasant but no one engaging with me or assisting with my experience. I did observe at least one gentleman who appeared to be security as he lingered in the aisles and repeatedly paused to watch people. He didn't have any belongings or groceries. He nor any other uniformed employee didn't ask if we needed any help. Cashier didn't engage at all other than to ask if we needed a bag.",

There's a separate deli meat and sliced cheese department and a gourmet cheese and set of tapas department.\n\nThe meat department seemed small, but it makes sense for the area, which is the tourist center.\n\nOther departments include canned and boxed food, international food, cleaning supplies, paper products, pet products and such like any large grocery store in the US.\n\nVery clean store.

We got in late Friday night and was able to get some shopping done before the 11pm closing time. The store looked organized with all of your grocery needs. There is a liquor store on the second floor too. Security was on duty so we felt safe. The prices seem comparable to other supermarkets. They also have a rewards program which I didn't look into because I don't have one of these near where I live. There were self checkouts and you can purchase bags for 5 cents a piece. Overall, a nice grocery store located in the city.",

I wonder how many time this store's staff was going to play favoritism and breaking the common rules, i wonder if she will tell me to cut other people's line if I was in the line once? BTW the soda stream refills are barely $16\/bottle, and it's $31.99\/bottle here.
